						<h3>FIGHT CLUB(1999)</h3>
						<p>Guaranteed: Fight Club will blow your skirt up. It's not just the rush of seeing Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and director David Fincher hit career peaks in a groundbreaking film. And it's not the sick kick of watching Gen X amateurs bare-knuckling each other in seedy basements; that'd get old fast. The film's bold, bruising humor leaves marks on a wide range of hot-button issues: It's about being young, male and powerless against the pacifying drug of consumerism. It's about solitude, despair and bottled-up rage. It's about how not to feel dead as Y2K approaches. It's about daring to imagine the disenfranchised reducing the world to rubble and starting over.

For daring to imagine, Fight Club will take a few hits. Fincher's film of Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel – with a high-voltage script by newcomer Jim Uhls – is already being misinterpreted as an "apology for fascism." One critic wondered whether Rupert Murdoch's Fox 2000, the company releasing Fight Club, "knew what it was doing" in spending $70 million on a movie that is "not only anti-capitalism but anti-society and, indeed, anti-God." My take is that Fight Club is pro-thinking, no matter what deities are offended. Is that threatening? You bet.
Fincher (Seven, The Game), superbly served by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and editor James Haygood, makes brilliant use of film language to take us inside the head of the story's narrator (Norton) – a yuppie drone whose mind is on fire with revolutionary ideas. This wired insomniac refers to himself as Jack, after a series of magazine articles in which organs of the...

						<h3>SCREAM(1996)</h3>
						<p>Wes Craven's “Scream” violates one of the oldest rules in movie history: It's about characters who go to the movies. They've even heard of movie stars. They refer by name to Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Jamie Lee Curtis. They analyze motivations (“Did Norman Bates have a motive? Did Hannibal Lecter have a reason for wanting to eat people?”) True, they went to the movies in “The Last Picture Show” and the heroes of “Clerks” worked in a video store. Even Bonnie and Clyde went to the movies. But those movies were about the *act* of going to the movies. “Scream” is about *knowledge* of the movies: The characters in “Scream” are in a horror film, and because they've seen so many horror films, they know what to do, and what not to do. “Don't say 'I'll be right back,' “one kid advises a friend, “because whenever anybody says that, he's *never* right back.” In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film criticism involves “deconstruction” of movie plots. “Deconstruction” is an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in words nobody can understand. “Scream” is self-deconstructing; it's like one of those cans that heats its own soup.
Instead of leaving it to the audience to anticipate the horror clichés, the characters talk about them openly. “Horror movies are always about some big-breasted blond who runs upstairs so the slasher can corner her,” says a character in “Scream.” “I hate it when characters are that stupid.” The movie begins, of course, with a young woman (Drew Barrymore) at home alone. She gets a threatening...

								<h3>THE DICTATOR2012)</h3>
								<p>"The Dictator" is funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, crude and so on. Having seen Sacha Baron Cohen promoting it on countless talk shows, I feared the movie would feel like deja vu. But no. He establishes a claim to be the best comic filmmaker now working. And in a speech about dictatorships, he practices merciless political satire.

Compared to the gleeful transgressions of "Borat" and "Bruno," this is Cohen's most conventional film. It has a plot, it has a romance, it sticks to the story. Not that it's mainstream, although judging by the laughter of a preview audience, who knows where the stream is anymore? He also wisely gets in, gets his laughs, and quits. The movie, like Bruno," falls short of 90 minutes, in an era where too many comedies run on relentlessly.

Cohen plays General Admiral Aladeen of the North African nation of Wadiya, which seems superimposed upon parts of Egypt and Sudan and is a spitting distance from Saudi Arabia. Here he occupies a huge palace, used for addressing admiring throngs of his worshippers and having sex not only with Megan Fox, but also, judging by his wall of post-coital Polaroids, Kim Kardashian, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Oprah. Megan Fox has a great cameo, showing up for sex but drawing the line at an all-night cuddle.
Aladeen's premier is Tahir (Ben Kingsley), rightful heir to the throne, who is plotting to overthrow him. After an assassination fails, Tahir encourages Aladeen to address the United Nations, where he hopes another assassination will succeed. After being de-bearded by a...
